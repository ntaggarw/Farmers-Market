        <p style="color: white;">The plan to bring the farmers' market back to life.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!--Clear need, problem and opportunity-->
    <div class="sectionOne">
    <h2>Breakdown</h2>
    <p>The situation was clear, unlike the weather: the farmers market lost
      business because the schedule was dependent on the weather. A lack of
      a proper communication stream was revealed to be the problem because the
      main factor in confusion was miscommunication about whether the event was
      to be hosted.</p>
    <p>So we stepped in to offer a plan to install the missing stream.</p>
    </div>
    <!--How the solution works (Semantics)-->
    <div class="sectionTwo">
    <h3>Semantics</h3>
    <p>The website would work to be the passive online presence of the market,
      to act as the reliable hub of necessary information. If a knowing consumer
      ever had a question pertaining to the market, they know where to find the
      answers.</p>
    <p>The newsletter would act as the aggressive informer, contacting both old
      and potential new consumers about the market, what would be there, the location,
      and of course the website address itself.</p>
    </div>
    <!--How solution addresses problem-->
    <div class="sectionOne">
    <h3>Application</h3>
    <p>Through this two step process, the market creates a two point communication
      stream between it and its customers. The newsletter acts to remind the lost
      individual of the status of the event, while the website has all the details.</p>
    </div>
    <!--Sketch of solution and reaction-->
    <div class="sectionThree">
    <h2>Reception</h2>
    <img src="images/Diagram.png" /><br>
    <caption>While the newsletter contacts the customers, a customer can check
      the website at their own discretion.</caption>
    <p>The advantage of this system to the populace is that they do not need to
      put any effort in involuntarily to get their information. The newsletter
      does the work sending information, and only specific information requires
      any more work, which would be a simple click of the link.</p>
