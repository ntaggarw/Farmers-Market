    <!--Introduction to the Problem - Summary-->
    <div class="contentContainer">
      <div class="sectionOne">
      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>Farmers Markets are not a necessarily new trend. In fact, the farmers' market derives
        from the original markeplace before the existence of supermarkets and large
        vendors. A <b>farmers market</b> is a markeplace in which many small vendors
        congregate in order to sell their goods together.</p>
      <p>Since these events are usually hosted outside, environmental conditions
        have a large bearing over whether the market happens. This inconsistency
        causes a loss in business, because consumers do not have a reliable method
        of tracking whether the event is taking place.</p>
      </div>
      <!--Research and Analysis - Selection-->
      <div class="sectionTwo">
      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>Being a resident of Chicago, I naturally found the supermarket as the
        most convenient place to shop. Everything was present in one place, there were
        labels on everything, and easy logistics when it came time to purchase my goods.</p>
      <p>So why did I switch to the farmers market?</p>
      <p>It always came down to a balance of trade-offs. As I got older, I attained
        or realized certain conditions I had that made the goods at a farmers market
        preferable to me. There is also a qualitative difference between the goods.</p>

      <p>I have severe allergies to pollen, which gets ever the more worse in the
        spring. I learned from a friend that local honey can reduce my symptoms;
        the only honey that worked was from a farmer in the market, who kept bees
        in the Chicagoland area. The honey was uniquely mixed so that it tasted
        better than any store-bought I tried. So when I can, I favor the Farmers
        market over the supermarket, even though it is a bit more walking and money.</p>

      <!--Solution-->
      <div class="sectionOne">
      <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
      <p>Upon taking surveys and analyzing our research, we concluded that a
        combination of two simple methods would be enough to keep the status of the
        farmers market as lucid as possible.</p>
      <p>We decided that the best approach would be to implement a website that keeps
        track of three things:</p>
      <ol>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Current dates and locations the farmers market will be happening.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">What each vendor attending has in stock.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Requests for certain products or vendors.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>There will also be an option to sign up for the second part of the solution:
        a weekly newsletter that will give all the above information succinctly to
        those who wish to simply stay informed.</p>
