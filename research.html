    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>We gathered our own data on top of secondary
      sources to help make our conclusions for how we
      would attempt this venture.</p>

    <!--Primary Research-->
    <h2>Our Research</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest obstacles we had to tackle was
      what form our solution would take. Since we knew relatively
      well what information needed to be transmitted, we just needed
      to decide method of reception. Thus, we put together a survey
      to ask that very question. It became apparent from the results
      that the majority wanted a website. But as we included another
      open-ended question on the survey about what other medium they
      would prefer, we realized that a newsletter would be more efficient.</p>
    <blockquote>
      I said a website because I thought it would be cool to see all
      the different foods, but I would honestly love to just see one of those
      spam emails that tell you everything so i don't have to check.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Therefore, we concluded from our primary research that the best
      approach would be to implement both, to grab a bigger majority of
      the consumers.</p>
    <!--Secondary Research-->
    <h2>Other Sources</h2>
    <p>We wanted to see what important information would we need to include in the
      newsletter/website, so we pulled up <b>Farmers Markets: Consumer Trends,
      Preferences, and Characteristics</b> as our source. This study provides an
      overview of attitudes, preferences and characteristics of consumers who
      shop at farmers’ markets. This helped give us an idea of what we wanted to
      include in our newsletter.</p>
    <p>Then we aimed to determine the scope of the problem, and thus our audience.
      In combination with the previous journal, this journal allowed us a
      comprehensive view of who we were aiming to send our newsletters to.
      <b>A Profile of Farmers' Market Consumers and the Perceived Advantages of
      Produce Sold at Farmers' Markets</b> The demographics revealed that the
      majority of our consumers were more likely to be female, married, and
      post-graduate.</p>
